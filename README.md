code 1:PaperClassPlot use R to draw image in type svg and png, we use Photoshop transfer png to tiff and use inkscape to tansfer svg to ai.
code 2:Idem. By using python.
Attention: Using inkscape should use pdf type export, but we should change the extension from pdf to ai.

solution:
If you’ve encountered a client or colleague who needs a copy of whatever you’ve been working on in Inkscape, but they’re requesting it in AI format, you’re in luck. This is actually quite simple.

Although Inkscape doesn’t allow you to directly save files in AI format, you can simply save it in PDF format, then change the extension from .pdf to .ai by renaming it. This will transform it into a makeshift Illustrator file and the person on the receiving end won’t know the difference.
